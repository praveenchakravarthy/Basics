    <h2>Helping the Community</h2>
    <hr>
 <p>
    It is very clear for ReadyAssist that they will always remain an asset less company owning no mechanics or any service providers under their direct payroll. This is to ensure that they cross leverage the existing skills available in the market and help improving the life and life style of the existing mechanic community than building their own.
</p>
<br>
<p>In their efforts to make everyone understand the vision of the company, they have been mentoring and grooming the mechanics to focus more on providing better experience to the customers to achieve the long term vision than looking at short term benefits.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This approach of ReadyAssist has brought in life to many such service providers, including few opening their own garages, making money to pay for vehicle EMIs which were about to be sold otherwise, expanding the business and creating many more job opportunities.
